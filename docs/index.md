Welcome to my Data Science and Software Development portfolio

I am currently in the early stages of filling this site with examples of my work and hope to have it up soon.

If you are interested in getting in contact with me then I can be reached on [Linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allanbond/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/allanjbond), or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/allan-bond).

## About me

I am an aspiring Data Scientist who has been working in the pharmaceutical industry for the past 10 years. Although my current role does not utilise the skills I have gained through my path to becoming a Data Scientist I believe that I have been able to develop my soft skills in leadership, communication, and training.

I have recently completed a Graduate Certificate in Data Science which I feel complements my other degrees as well as non-formal studies.
